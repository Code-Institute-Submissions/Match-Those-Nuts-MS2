#Match that Dough!

##About

The purpose of this game was to create and build a single webpage. A card matching game that is super colorful and fun to play. The overall purpose of this game was to showcase my Javascript skills I've learned recently through Code Academy. 

I specifically chose this game because the central theme of revolves around doughnuts. That's important to me since I actually work in a doughnut shop and want to showcase this game in the future in the shop as a way for customers to engage with us and our products. The idea is for people to play the game and whoever solved it the fastest or under a certain amount of clicks would win a prize.
Therefore, all the photos used in this game are from the actual doughnuts we sell in the shop and all the flavours of doughnuts we make.
